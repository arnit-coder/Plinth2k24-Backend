ISSUES (## -> resolevd)
1. Don't send otp to frontend in the response of auth/sendotp (the person can enter the otp without having to check the mail and can enter using wrong mail also cuz he is getting the otp in the broswer )

2. auth/sendotp route is giving response as 200 even if the mail is not sent  (it should give 400)

## 3. OTP is not saving in the database .
